# [my-cpp-handbook][repo]

Small exercises and experiments on the C++ language.

Each exercise tries to cope some core aspect of the language, but focused on how
to solve problemas using it.

Complexity will grow each exercise, and the background history as well. It's the
same formula from [my golang handbook][my-golang-handbook]

Think about C++ is to think about the computer history itself. The language
predates the internet and born to ease the task of writing core things, like
operational systems and network stacks. There is one standard, yet many idioms,
many libraries, many compilers.

The language is still evolving. And yet it still holds great retrocompatibility
with [C][c] language.

## Base agenda

We are covering at least the following topics:

- Hello world
- Basic input (environment, arguments, interactive)
- Primitive types
- Basic control structures
- Functions
- Custom types
- Classes
- Compilation and compilers
- Basic IO (files)
- Project structure
- Modularity (how to separate and organize code)
- The standard library
- IDE's
- Debugging
- Intermediate IO (socket networking)
- Concurrency
- Cross-Compiling
