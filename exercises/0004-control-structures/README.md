# Control flow

Blocks, conditionals and loops.

In C++, the most basic structure is the block. A block is defined by a `{}` and
anything between them belongs to the block. This is true for several languages.

The `main` function, the [application entry point][entrypoint], owns a block.
Conditional and repetition structures can own a block.

## How to build
