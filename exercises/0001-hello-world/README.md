# The Hello World

Outputs 'Hello World!' in the console.

## How to build

g++ main.cc -o hello
```

if you have clang instead:

```bash
clang++ main.cc -o hello
```

## How to run

```bash
./hello
```

## Noteworthy

Since the advent of multitasking, all that modern computer needs to work is an
Operating System (or [Control Program][control-program], if you ar that old) and
a compiler (or an interpreted language, such as [BASIC][basic]). Things are like
that because the programs need to be compiled for that specific combination of
hardware and OS.
